# GOHDE-Cosmology
The MCMC burned chains of the analysis carried out for the GOHDE and wGOHDE cosmological models.

The article, which presents an analysis, is presently undergoing review in a scholarly journal. Following publication, all wGOHDE and GOHDE chains will be made accessible. An earlier iteration of the article can be accessed via the arXiv ID: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12409. Please note that while the conclusions in the revised version have been adjusted, the fundamental model remains unchanged.

All files are stored in CSV format, with the initial line as an indicator of variable names. The initial column in each CSV file corresponds to the final number of burned-in chain points. All parameters were generated until the change in log-likelihood was less than 0.1.
